        "answer": "**Answer:**\nPhotosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose. This process occurs in two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle). During the light-dependent reactions, chlorophyll in the chloroplasts captures sunlight, producing ATP (energy) and NADPH (reducing power). These molecules are then used in the light-independent reactions to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) into glucose (C6H12O6), using the energy from ATP and NADPH.\n\n####"
